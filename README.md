# 🚀 AI-Powered RAG Document Management System

This repository contains a corporate-grade document management solution that leverages Artificial Intelligence for semantic search. Developed during my internship at **Narveri Eğitim Bilişim**, this project showcases the integration of modern backend frameworks with AI-driven retrieval systems.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Semantic Search (RAG):** Advanced retrieval system using **pgVector** for context-aware document querying.
* **Enterprise Security:** Robust security layer built with **Spring Security** featuring multi-role authorization.
* **Automated Processing:** High-speed document handling and storage integration via **Uploadcare API**.
* **Clean Architecture:** Follows a layered, maintainable architecture designed for scalability and performance.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Spring Security, MapStruct, PostgreSQL (pgVector).
- **Frontend:** React (ES6+).
- **Standards:** RESTful APIs, Git/GitHub, Agile Methodology, Postman.

## 👨‍🏫 Acknowledgments & Mentorship
This project was developed within a professional framework. I would like to thank my mentor at **Narveri Eğitim Bilişim** for providing the initial boilerplate and guidance. During this process, I was specifically responsible for:
1. Designing and implementing the **vector-based search** architecture.
2. Configuring the **Spring Security** and RBAC layers.
3. Managing **PostgreSQL** data models and API development.
